('CVE-2024-22423', 'yt-dlp is a youtube-dl fork with additional features and fixes. The patch that addressed CVE-2023-40581 attempted to prevent RCE when using `--exec` with `%q` by replacing double quotes with two double quotes. However, this escaping is not sufficient, and still allows expansion of environment variables. Support for output template expansion in `--exec`, along with this vulnerable behavior, was added to `yt-dlp` in version 2021.04.11. yt-dlp version 2024.04.09 fixes this issue by properly escaping `%`. It replaces them with `%%cd:~,%`, a variable that expands to nothing, leaving only the leading percent. It is recommended to upgrade yt-dlp to version 2024.04.09 as soon as possible. Also, always be careful when using `--exec`, because while this specific vulnerability has been patched, using unvalidated input in shell commands is inherently dangerous. For Windows users who are not able to upgrade, avoid using any output template expansion in `--exec` other than `{}` (filepath); if expansion in `--exec` is needed, verify the fields you are using do not contain `"`, `|` or `&`; and/or instead of using `--exec`, write the info json and load the fields from it instead.', 'CRITICAL', 'CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H', 'HIGH', 'NONE', 'REQUIRED', 'HIGH', 'HIGH', 'HIGH', 'av:n/ac:l/pr:n/ui:n/s:u/c:h/i:h/a:h', '**Description of CVE-2024-22423**\n\nThis CVE refers to a security vulnerability discovered in yt-dlp, which is a software tool used for downloading videos from YouTube and various other websites. In this case, the vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially execute remote code on a user\'s system through a feature called "--exec" that allows for the execution of custom commands during the download process. \n\nThe specific issue arises from the insufficient escaping of certain characters when using the output template expansion feature in the "--exec" command. Even though an attempt was made to address a similar vulnerability in a previous version, the fix was found to be incomplete, leaving room for exploitation. Malicious actors could take advantage of this vulnerability to manipulate environment variables and potentially run unauthorized commands on the affected system.\n\nThe maintainers of yt-dlp have released version 2024.04.09, which includes a comprehensive fix for this vulnerability by properly escaping the problematic characters. It is strongly recommended for users to upgrade to this latest version to protect their systems from potential attacks. Additionally, users are advised to exercise caution when using the "--exec" feature, as executing untrusted commands can pose significant security risks.\n\n**Description of the Company/Vendor**\n\nyt-dlp is a fork of the popular youtube-dl tool, which is widely used by individuals who want to download videos from various online platforms for offline viewing. While the original youtube-dl project is no longer actively maintained due to legal issues, yt-dlp emerged as a community-driven alternative with additional features and improvements. It is developed and maintained by a team of open-source enthusiasts who contribute to its ongoing development.\n\nThe user base of yt-dlp consists of a diverse range of individuals who value the flexibility and functionality provided by the tool. From casual users looking to save their favorite videos for later viewing to content creators and researchers who rely on downloading online media for their work, yt-dlp serves a broad audience with different needs.\n\n**Why this poses a threat to general audiences**\n\nThis vulnerability in yt-dlp poses a significant threat to general audiences, as it could potentially allow malicious actors to execute harmful commands on their systems. Given the popularity of online video content and the widespread use of tools like yt-dlp for downloading purposes, the impact of such an attack could be severe.\n\nBy exploiting this vulnerability, attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, manipulate files on the victim\'s system, or even take control of the entire machine. This type of unauthorized access can lead to data breaches, privacy violations, and financial losses for individuals and organizations alike.\n\n**Possible Solutions**\n\n1. Upgrade yt-dlp to the latest version 2024.04.09 as soon as possible to apply the patch that fixes the vulnerability.\n2. Exercise caution when using the "--exec" feature in yt-dlp and avoid executing commands that contain untrusted or unknown inputs.\n3. For Windows users unable to upgrade immediately, restrict the use of output template expansion in "--exec" to only include filepath information enclosed in curly braces `{}`.\n4. If advanced functionality is required, consider validating and sanitizing inputs before using them in the "--exec" command to prevent potential exploitation.\n5. As an alternative to using "--exec", consider saving necessary information to a separate file (such as info.json) and extracting the required fields from there instead of executing commands directly.', '9.8', '2024-04-09 18:36:39')
('CVE-2024-24576', "Rust is a programming language. The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the Rust standard library prior to version 1.77.2 did not properly escape arguments when invoking batch files (with the `bat` and `cmd` extensions) on Windows using the `Command`. An attacker able to control the arguments passed to the spawned process could execute arbitrary shell commands by bypassing the escaping. The severity of this vulnerability is critical for those who invoke batch files on Windows with untrusted arguments. No other platform or use is affected.\n\nThe `Command::arg` and `Command::args` APIs state in their documentation that the arguments will be passed to the spawned process as-is, regardless of the content of the arguments, and will not be evaluated by a shell. This means it should be safe to pass untrusted input as an argument.\n\nOn Windows, the implementation of this is more complex than other platforms, because the Windows API only provides a single string containing all the arguments to the spawned process, and it's up to the spawned process to split them. Most programs use the standard C run-time argv, which in practice results in a mostly consistent way arguments are splitted.\n\nOne exception though is `cmd.exe` (used among other things to execute batch files), which has its own argument splitting logic. That forces the standard library to implement custom escaping for arguments passed to batch files. Unfortunately it was reported that our escaping logic was not thorough enough, and it was possible to pass malicious arguments that would result in arbitrary shell execution.\n\nDue to the complexity of `cmd.exe`, we didn't identify a solution that would correctly escape arguments in all cases. To maintain our API guarantees, we improved the robustness of the escaping code, and changed the `Command` API to return an [`InvalidInput`][4] error when it cannot safely escape an argument. This error will be emitted when spawning the process.\n\nThe fix is included in Rust 1.77.2. Note that the new escaping logic for batch files errs on the conservative side, and could reject valid arguments. Those who implement the escaping themselves or only handle trusted inputs on Windows can also use the `CommandExt::raw_arg` method to bypass the standard library's escaping logic.
